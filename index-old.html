                                    The story is a little different in each ward. In the late 90s, homes in Wards 2 and 3 were considerably more expensive than homes in other areas, with median home prices around $500,000 in early 1996. Median prices in other wards, meanwhile, were clustered together between $100,000 and $200,000 until 2001, when a few wards rose above the pack. Gentrifying neighborhoods pushed up prices in Wards 1 and 6 to over $600,000 by the end of 2013. Increases followed a bit later in Wards 4 and 5, as homebuyers began looking in more parts of the city to find affordable homes.

                                    Prices also rose in Wards 7 and 8, but have since fallen to the low $200,000s. While Wards 2 and 3 still lead by a good margin, other wards are more spread out across the price spectrum now than in the 1990s.

                                <p>Affordable rental options are critical for diverse communities. Some renters may not be able to afford to buy a home, at least not yet, while others may want or need to be more mobile. Low-income families and workers depend on the rental market to find adequate housing, but DC renters are losing lower-cost options.

                                    While the rental market has grown—from 2005 to 2012, roughly 12,500 more apartments and homes were occupied by renters—the number of lower-cost, market-rate units fell steadily, as higher-rent units took over a greater share of rentals.

                                    In 2005, over 65,000 rentals were available for under $800 a month (in 2012 dollars); by 2012, that number had fallen to roughly 34,000 units. Meanwhile, the number of rentals for $1,000 or more shot up from about 51,000 units in 2005 to nearly 98,000 in 2012.

                                    In 2011, nearly 67 percent of people who moved to the city within the past year were ages 18 to 34, up from 57 percent in 2005. Meanwhile, only 30 percent of current residents were in that age range. The share of new residents with bachelor's and graduate degrees (65 percent) in 2011 was higher than the share of degree-holders already living in the city then (42 percent).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A higher share of newcomers than current residents in 2011 were two-person households without children (38 percent versus 27 percent), while more current residents than newcomers had children (38 percent versus 22 percent). Single-person households made up roughly the same share in both groups.

                                <p>
                                    A slightly bigger share of newcomers than current residents were in the middle- and high-income categories, and fewer new residents had extremely low incomes, but the real differences may be yet to come. The data capture earnings of young, highly educated newcomers who are just starting out in the job market, but many are poised to earn more later in their careers.

From 2002 to 2013, approximately 600 condo developments, 4,000 single family homes, and 680 rental apartment buildings have been built or converted from vacant or nonresidential properties. And, according to the

The records include information on parcel use (e.g., residential or commercial), type of property on the site, and the year the property was built. The colored areas are land parcels with residential properties built between 2002 and 2013 or parcels that showed changes from nonresidential to residential uses. Parcel boundaries were obtained from an OCTO map file, which is overlaid on a base map displaying streets and building footprints. In some cases, a colored area with new housing may represent a larger parcel that was later divided into multiple types of uses, only some of which are residential.</p>

                                <p>While economic growth and the building boom have revitalized DC communities, many lower-income residents haven’t shared in that prosperity. As the cost of housing rises, DC has become increasingly unaffordable, going by the widely used standard that only 30 percent of income should be spent on housing. Many households in DC spend much more than that on rent or mortgage payments, leaving less for food, health care, and other basic needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    How affordable (or unaffordable) is DC?
                                    <a href="http://www.urban.org/publications/413161.html" target="_blank">Let’s consider what households with different incomes can afford</a>. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development categorizes households by how they compare with the median income in an area. In 2011, the median income in the Washington region was $106,100 for a family of four. That means that a four-person family supported by, say, a paramedic earning $46,400 a year is considered very low income and can afford to pay up to $1,160 a month for rent. The same-sized family supported by a dental hygienist earning $90,460 is middle income and can afford $2,262 a month in rent.
                                </p>

                                    From 2000 to 2011, the number of rentals that were affordable for low-income, very low-income, and extremely low-income households either fell or increased only slightly, while the number of rentals that only middle- or high-income households could afford rose rapidly, particularly for studio and one-bedroom apartments that would be suitable for one- or two-person households.

                                <p>For households that can’t afford market-rate housing, assisted housing programs fill an essential gap between what these households can pay and what the unit costs.

                                    Assisted housing can be found in many neighborhoods throughout the city—including areas that are growing rapidly and those that haven’t grown much yet. Fast-growing neighborhoods, like Shaw and Logan Circle, have become expensive, putting subsidized housing there at risk. Owners and developers may decide it is more lucrative to switch from providing assisted housing to providing luxury apartments or condominiums. Losing assisted units in these neighborhoods would be devastating as it would then become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to create new assisted apartments in these neighborhoods.

                                <p>If we want to maintain DC as an inclusive and diverse city, we need to provide a diversity of housing that meets the needs of all residents—owners and renters, high-income and low-income households, single adults and large families. That’s the consistent message from past city administrations and from Mayor Vincent Gray’s housing task force, which, in 2013, came up with a
                                    <a href="http://www.taskforce2012.org/Portals/1/docs/Bridges_to_Opportunity-A_New_Housing_Strategy_for_DC-Official_Report.pdf" target="_blank">long-term affordable housing strategy</a> for the city. Gray has
                                    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/2013/02/05/1d8bf410-6fe5-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html" target="_blank">pledged $100 million</a> toward achieving one of the task force’s main goals: creating and preserving 10,000 new subsidized housing units by 2020.
                                    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2014/08/07/officials-say-d-c-is-halfway-to-goal-of-10000-affordable-housing-units/" target="_blank">City officials said</a> that DC is halfway there, with 5,938 units built or under construction.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Housing Production Trust Fund and the DC Local Rent Supplement Program, which use local tax dollars to subsidize developers and providers of affordable housing, are critical to achieving the task force’s goals. DC’s Inclusionary Zoning policy, implemented in 2009, also may prove to be an important tool to spur development of affordable housing and mixed-income communities. The policy requires that new residential buildings set aside a percentage of its units for low- and moderate-income households. The policy has gotten off to a slow start, but is beginning to make progress.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But the needs are still great. As DC continues to grow, inclusive housing policies will help ensure that the city remains affordable for all its residents.
