                            <p class="lead">Violent crime has fallen dramatically both nationwide and in DC over the past 20 years. The District’s homicide rate has plunged, taking the city far from its days as the nation’s “murder capital.” And, despite some ups and downs, aggravated assaults and robberies—two key elements of violent crime—are also on the decline.</p>
                            <p class="lead">However, these improvements have been uneven across the District. Stubborn pockets of violent crime remain unchanged in some neighborhoods, particularly in Northeast and Southeast DC. Tackling this persistent violent crime will require a more holistic public safety approach—one that goes beyond policing to include social services and that <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/creating-partners-public-safety">emphasizes prevention</a> instead of reaction. </p>

                            <p>Researchers are still figuring out what caused the nationwide drop in violent crime in the mid- to late 90s. Among cities experiencing this decline, DC stands out for being particularly successful at extending that crime decline over time. That success is due in large part to a renewed emphasis on community-oriented policing and evidence-based tactics, as well as changing demographics and economic growth.</p>
                            <p>
                                Building on the work of former police chief Charles Ramsey, DC Police Chief Cathy Lanier has <a href="http://www.urban.org/events/stop-and-frisk-role-police-strategies-and-tactics-police-community-relations">emphasized community engagement</a> by increasing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/15/AR2007011501095.html">foot patrols</a>, using

                                What’s more, DC’s police department has invested in <a href="http://www.urban.org/events/putting-homicide-rates-their-place">new technologies</a>, like <a href="http://datatools.urban.org/features/everydayviolence/">gunfire detection sensors</a> and body cameras for police, and has

                                <p>
                                    Aggravated assaults are serious physical attacks, often involving a deadly weapon like a gun or knife. The rate of aggravated assaults per 1,000 people in DC fell significantly from 8.0 in 2000 to 5.8 in 2013. The biggest declines occurred in the Navy Yard and Barry Farm <a href="http://www.neighborhoodinfodc.org/nclusters/nclusters.html">neighborhood clusters</a> in Southeast DC, Ivy City-Trinidad in Northeast DC, and the downtown-Chinatown and Cardozo-Shaw clusters in Northwest DC.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, some areas had smaller declines, particularly in neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. The population east of the river also grew only a small amount during this period, meaning that the lack of decline in crime rates can’t be explained by changes in the neighborhood’s population.
                                </p>

                                <p>Robberies, where the offender uses or threatens force, are considered violent crimes, while thefts like pickpocketing or burglaries are not. These crimes followed roughly the same trend as aggravated assaults in the District. In many areas, including downtown DC, the Navy Yard, and Dupont Circle, robbery declined substantially.</p>
                                <p>However, robberies increased in neighborhoods like River Terrace, Benning, and Greenway. Again, population changes can’t explain the increase in robberies because these neighborhoods gained only a small number of residents from 2000 to 2014.</p>

                                <p>
                                    In 2012, DC hit a record low of 88 homicides, down from a peak of 397 in 1996. Homicides have gone up slightly since then, hovering around 100 a year. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/dc-homicides-jump-20-percent-amid-a-surge-in-may-june/2015/06/25/2effd93c-1b37-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a_story.html">number of homicides at the midpoint of 2015</a> suggest that this trend may continue.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This dramatic drop in homicides from 1990s levels stems from a number of possible factors, including economic growth, demographic changes, and improvements in policing strategies. Additionally, the decrease may reflect changes like better medical care and improved EMT response times, which play an important role in preventing deaths due to violence.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, the recent uptick suggests that a broader array of strategies may be needed to further reduce homicides. For example, a growing number of homicides are related to domestic violence: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/homicides-remain-steady-in-district-prince-georges/2014/12/31/cccb5428-8606-11e4-9534-f79a23c40e6c_story.html">17 in 2014 compared with 9 in 2012</a>. Addressing homicides like these requires social service interventions, rather than relying on policing alone.

                                <p>
                                    Looking at violent crime by <a href="http://www.neighborhoodinfodc.org/nclusters/nclusters.html">neighborhood cluster</a>, the biggest drop in crime occurred in the Navy Yard area, one of DC’s fastest-growing neighborhoods. From 2000 to 2014, the rate of violent crime fell from 59 crimes for every 1,000 residents to 6. The violent crime rate also fell considerably in the downtown-Chinatown-Penn Quarter cluster.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During the same period, while crime was declining citywide, the violent crime rate increased slightly in four adjacent neighborhood clusters in Ward 7: Eastland Gardens-Kenilworth, Deanwood-Lincoln Heights, Mayfair-Hillbrook, and River Terrace-Benning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Measuring crimes per residents allows us to compare neighborhoods of different sizes, but it’s also important to note that these four Ward 7 neighborhood clusters have much smaller populations and lower raw crime numbers than large areas, like the downtown-Chinatown cluster. For example, Kenilworth, an area of roughly 2,300 residents, experienced 63 violent crimes in 2014, while the Chinatown area, home to some 13,600 residents, experienced 234 violent crimes. Navy Yard, though, is more comparable in population size to Kenilworth, with about 2,800 residents, and had only 18 violent crimes in 2014.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many areas saw little to no change in the violent crime rate over the past 15 years. Stable crime levels can mean very different things. Several neighborhood clusters in upper northwest DC, for example, started out with a very low crime rate and have maintained it, while other neighborhoods have higher crime rates that remain unchanged. Therefore, much of DC’s reduction in violent crime is due to big declines in a few neighborhoods that previously had high levels of violence.
                                </p>

Navy Yard</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Originally a hub for military manufacturing, by the 1990s, the Navy Yard area was a troubled neighborhood polluted by years of industrial production. Beginning in 2000, a sustained campaign of public and private redevelopment transformed the neighborhood, bringing in a wide array of businesses and Nationals Park stadium. This growth was likely one of several reasons crime dropped so dramatically. Increased activity may have made committing crimes more difficult, led to a higher police presence, or encouraged the delivery of better public services.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is also a feedback effect: the drop in crime, coupled with other changes, attracted more residents, encouraging growth and economic development. Average family income in Navy Yard <a href="http://www.neighborhoodinfodc.org/nclusters/Nbr_prof_clusb27.html">rose 147 percent between 2000 and 2008-2012</a>, and now stands at about $93,170. During that same period, the median price of a home in the area grew rapidly, <a href="http://www.neighborhoodinfodc.org/nclusters/Nbr_prof_clusc27.html">from $162,000 in 2000 to $784,000 in 2012</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Amid this economic expansion, the neighborhood’s population grew substantially, from 1,825 residents in 2000 to about 2,800 residents in 2010, while the total number of violent crimes declined from 108 to 18. The 2013 spike in the homicide rate reflects the tragic Navy Yard shooting on September 16.

Eastland Gardens-Kenilworth</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The Eastland Gardens-Kenilworth area is largely residential, adjacent to the Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, with many long-term residents. These neighborhoods have homeownership rates that are higher than average for neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, but have faced <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/dc-promise-neighborhood-initiative-needs-assessment-and-segmentation-analysis">persistently high poverty and unemployment rates</a>: between 2000 and 2008-2012 the poverty rate went up from <a href="http://www.neighborhoodinfodc.org/nclusters/Nbr_prof_clusb29.html">28 percent to 43 percent</a>. The average family income declined by 17 percent over the same period. Also, these neighborhoods are geographically cut off from the rest of the city by the Anacostia Freeway on the east and the Anacostia River to the west. Limited access to public transportation further isolates residents.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Violent crime rose slightly in Eastland Gardens-Kenilworth and three other neighborhood clusters in Ward 7. The increases have been small, but violent crime was already high in these areas and is also concentrated in a few neighboring city blocks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Federal investment may help this community more forward. In 2010, the <a href="http://dcpni.org/">DC Promise Neighborhood Initiative</a>, which works in Eastland Gardens and Kenilworth, received federal funding for an ambitious effort to provide cradle-to-career supports, such as afterschool programs and access to health care, for children and their families. Increasing the number of children who feel safe at school or traveling to and from school is one of the initiative’s goals. The hope is that intensive social services will give the children and families in these neighborhoods the tools to build healthy, stable homes and careers.

                                    DC has made immense strides in public safety, but the crime-reduction strategies that have taken us to this point won’t be enough to build an even safer city. In a disturbing trend, an increasing number of homicides in DC have involved <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/homicides-remain-steady-in-district-prince-georges/2014/12/31/cccb5428-8606-11e4-9534-f79a23c40e6c_story.html">domestic or family violence</a>, which cannot be reduced through policing alone. We need a <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/creating-partners-public-safety">holistic approach</a> that involves social services, the police, nonprofits, and residents working together. Only by partnering can the city build healthier, safer communities—creating the social supports, stability, and opportunities that will bring down even the most persistent pockets of violent crime.
